If we look at the methods in repository class of SpringJPA, we will  notice that all the methods are quite generalized
and repetitive . It can be taken care by introducing predefined repositories like JpaRepository & CRUDRepository.
We can make use of already defined and implemented methods in these repositories to achieve almost everything


JpaRepository is an interface
CRUDRepository is a super interface of JpaRepository

You can find all implemented methods like find(), findAll(), findByid(), save(), etc in javadoc
