=> JPA = Java Persistence API
			It defines a set of annotations(@Entity, @Id, etc) and set of interfaces for ORM
			Thus  JPA permits the developer to work directly with objects rather than with SQL statements
			Queries are internally  generated by Hibernate
			Hibernate is the most popular implementation of JPA
			
JPA vs SpringJDBC => In SpringJdbc we have to implement RowMapper to map attributes to column names in case they are different
					But in JPA , this is achieved simply through annotations
					
In jPA , we use JPQL = Java Persistence Query Language to write named queries
JPQL does not use database, rather it uses Entities
