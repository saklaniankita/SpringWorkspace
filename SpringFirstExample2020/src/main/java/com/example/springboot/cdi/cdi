Container & Dependency Injection
CDI tried to standardized spring annotations (@Component, @Autowired, etc) as part of Java EE
It used:
	@Inject in place of @Autowired
	@Named in place of @Component/@Qualifier
We can use either cdi annotations which are part of JAVA EE or spring annotations. 
There is no specific difference
