Step 1: First request will be received by DispatcherServlet
Step 2: DispatcherServlet will take the help of HandlerMapping and get to know the Controller class name(within the 
        package mentioned in <context:component-scan> tag) associated with the given request
Step 3: So request transfer to the Controller, and then controller will process the request by executing 
        appropriate methods and returns ModeAndView object (contains Model data and View name) back to the 
        DispatcherServlet
Step 4: Now DispatcherServlet send the model object to the ViewResolver to get the actual view page by adding prefix 
        and suffix mentioned in view resolver bean
Step 5: Finally DispatcherServlet will pass the Model object to the View page to display the result
